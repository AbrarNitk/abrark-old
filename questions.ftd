-- ds.page: Question for Myself

Below questions, I will review at the end of the month.

Question: What really matters right now in my life? Am I dedicating the
necessary to do it?

Question: Are my current system and habits aligned with my long-term goals?

Question: What do I need to cut from my life to operate more efficiently?
