-- ds.page: Lessons From Amitu

Always use the name, do not use this or that. First figure out the name first.
Name should be consistent, across the concept.
Do not show false information.
Never ever you use `_` in the urls, use hiphens `-` instead. Use `/` in urls.
Urls is an identifier,  for a web page, Should always use urls with end slash `/`.
Every Task should be different states, updates should be reliable.
