- Simplify the architecture
- All the keys are managed by `fifthtry.com`
- OAuth implementation

- OAuth working with GitHub
- Shobhit will create a repository for auth purpose
- How can we have multiple authentication providers at one place



## Scenarios

## Wasif/Shobhit/Amitu Discussion

- Wasif figured out some oauth actix
- He will implement oauth application now
- It will be an standalone repo
- To make self hosting easy
  - Is that possible not to use database?
  - storage will be only in the cookie
  - It seems it is possible, using only cookies we can provide auth
- I can create a new git branch in fpm with integrated new fpm-auth (crate)
- Get some oauth working
