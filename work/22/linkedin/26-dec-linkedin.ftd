Hey Guys, I would like to tell you about FASTN, In FifthTry we are building a
CLI tool that has so many features in it for building and managing websites.

- As a static site generator, FASTN allows users to create HTML pages from FTD
files and data sources, without the need for a dynamic server-side language
like PHP or Ruby.

- FASTN also serves as a package manager for FTD, a programming language
specifically designed for building user interfaces.

- In addition to being a package manager, FASTN can also act as an HTTP server
for serving FTD files.

- FASTN includes a sitemap feature that allows users to map URLs to specific FTD
documents and handle dynamic URL mapping.

- With its processors feature, FASTN allows users to retrieve data from HTTP
requests, Databases, Rust functions within FTD files.

- FASTN can also act as a reverse proxy, forwarding HTTP requests to other servers
and returning the response to the original client.

- FASTN offers authentication capabilities, including the ability to log in using
OAuth with various providers such as GitHub, Discord, Twitter, and Telegram.

- FASTN also allows users to install applications as separate FASTN packages, which
are folders containing FTD files for the application.

If you're looking for a comprehensive tool to help you build and manage your
website, consider giving FASTN a try. It's a command-line interface tool that
offers a range of features, including static site generation, package management
for FTD files, and a built-in HTTP server. It also has a sitemap for mapping
URLs to specific documents, processors for retrieving data, and authentication
capabilities. Plus, it's easy to install and use, and you can even add
applications as separate FASTN packages.
