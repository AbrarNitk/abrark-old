-- ds.markdown:

Exercise:
- Practice: Read a sentence and write it in your language, goal should be write
as it is.
- Practice: Read a complete para and write it.

### Rule 0

Repeat these rule daily, add new rules, delete rules if they are not matching
your requirements

### Rule 1

Always try to focus what you are doing currently, do not think and do anything else

It can be office work, learning english, reading news paper, talking to someone, etc…

Example: Like ploughing fields with focus on hal.

Example: It can be learn from Kids. Kids enjoy what they doing, they just get
forgot if somebody have beaten them 5 mins ago. If they are playing in mud,
they don’t care they are just happy.

How to do it:

Try to think I can be better in doing something.

Like If you are typing so just focus on your brain actions and type the keyboard
button.

While you are coding, think about how better this function can be written.

### Rule 2

Do not judge yourself when you are around someone, just focus on what are doing.

- Do not think like: what I am doing currently, what are people thinking about it,
who are around me. You should not have a thread in your mind who are around you.


### Rule 3
Stop thinking about what is virtual.
Example: Khayalo mein khona band kar.

Uncertain thoughts make people anxious, and their not solving any problem,
If you are thinking about reality it is infinite.
