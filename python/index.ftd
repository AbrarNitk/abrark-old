-- ds.h1: What is Python

Python is a high level interpreted language. A high language which cannot be
directly understood by machine. High level code gets converted into bytecode
and then converted into machine code.

Python is an interpreted language because, during execution, each line is
interpreted to machine code on-the-go.
