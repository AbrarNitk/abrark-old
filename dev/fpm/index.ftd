-- ds.h1: Auth Implementation

## Current Implementation:

- User has to choose one platform like github or discord to login
- fpm will redirect than that user to chosen platform to login
- Than after successful login with chosen platform, platform will redirect to fpm
  with some shared token
- Than fpm set's the cookie-token which is fetched from the chosen platform

This is how we are setting cookie.

-- ftd.code:
lang: text

http header: cookie: access_token=<github-shared access token>;


-- ds.h1: Multi platform Authentication on fpm

On fpm, user can choose one authentication provider to login on one app and
another authentication provider on another application.

Let's take an example, On `todo` application user can choose google provider
but to manage `movies` user can chose to login with discord.

Question: If I have used different auth providers for different application to
logged in. So I have to remember that I have used google to manage my todos and
used discord to manage my movies.

That becomes problematic if I have used multiple apps and different auth
providers and have to logged in again on different browser.

- Note Points:
  - How app will identify which auth provider to use.
  - fpm can show all the already logged-in platforms and user just can check it.


## How to store session

### Without DB

- data will be stored in cookie only
- fpm instance will not use any db storage.
- Pros:
  - no db call to check authentication
- Cons:
 - sharing the authentication provider token
 - User has to login everytime for every auth provider if it switches the
   browser because all the information in the cookie only
 -

### With DB

- data will be stored in the db(shared/global/redis)
- single token will be stored with the session cookie
- Cons:
  - on every http request there will be db call to authenticate the person
- Pros:
  - If user logged out, all the information lost from fom server.
  - User has to logged in again for all the application with different auth provider.

## Discussion With Amitu

- We don't want to use db for authentication
- auth supports in fpm
- We can use multiple providers
  - facebook, apple, google, discord, google-docs, add them to google docs to
  access the page

-- ds.code:
lang: text

github_access_token: <>
google_access_token: <>
tid: hash(package_name) + git

-- ds.markdown:

- Till here we are clear.
- Note: We have to move github and all the auth providers to wasm.
- Cookie for different package: cookie_name: hash(package_name) + endpoint-cookie (_tid)
- We will remove hash(package_name) from cookie-name and send it to endpoint.
- Browser will always keep hash(package_name) + endpoint cookie
- /auth/login/ ==> /-/fifthtry.github.io/github/login/
- Any number of provider can login
- If the user is not authorize to access the page, show only title not 404
- In sitemap: confidential: true if yes then 404, instead of showing the 404
- If we are saying un authorized on /fire-abrar/, means we are leaking the info
