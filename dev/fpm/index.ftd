-- ds.h1: Auth Implementation

## Current Implementation:

- User has to choose one platform like github or discord to login
- fpm will redirect than that user to chosen platform to login
- Than after successful login with chosen platform, platform will redirect to fpm
  with some shared token
- Than fpm set's the cookie-token which is fetched from the chosen platform

This is how we are setting cookie.

-- ftd.code:
lang: text

http header: cookie: access_token=<github-shared access token>;


-- ds.h1: Multi platform Authentication on fpm

On fpm, user can choose one authentication provider to login on one app and
another authentication provider on another application.

Let's take an example, On `todo` application user can choose google provider
but to manage `movies` user can chose to login with discord.

Question: If I have used different auth providers for different application to
logged in. So I have to remember that I have used google to manage my todos and
used discord to manage my movies.

That becomes problematic if I have used multiple apps and different auth
providers and have to logged in again on different browser.


## How to store session

### Without DB

- data will be stored in cookie only
- fpm instance will not use any db storage.
- Pros:
  - no db call to check authentication
- Cons:
 - sharing the authentication provider token
 - User has to login everytime for every auth provider if it switches the
   browser because all the information in the cookie only
 -

### With DB

- data will be stored in the db(shared/global/redis)
- single token will be stored with the session cookie
- Cons:
  - on every http request there will be db call to authenticate the person
- Pros:
  - If user logged out, all the information lost from fom server.
  - User has to logged in again for all the application with different auth provider.
