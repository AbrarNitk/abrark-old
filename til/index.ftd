-- ds.h1: FPM.ftd has support for sitemap

It's pretty cool, in a very short succinct way you can create the sitemap for a
site. It looks something like this:

-- ds.code: sitemap lives in FPM.ftd
lang: ftd

\-- fpm.sitemap:

# Home: /

- Home: /
- About Me: /about/
- Resume: /resume/
- My Current Goals: /now/

# Tech Stuff: /tech/

## General: /tech/

- Overview: /tech/
- TIL: /til/

-- ds.markdown:

This is the sitemap of this site, and you can click around to see it in action.
